parallel-flickr
==

parallel-flickr is **not** a replacement for Flickr.

**THIS PROBABLY HAS BUGS (OR AT LEAST STUPID MISTAKES) BUT GENERALLY SEEMS TO WORK** It also needs to be documented.

To do:
--

* write files to S3 (see also: [flamework-aws](https://github.com/straup/flamework-aws))

* API hooks (see also: [flamework-api](https://github.com/straup/flamework-api))

* account deletion

* sync/update contacts

* cron jobs for backups

* display metadata

* permission checks for geo (currently not displayed)

* search (solr?)

* duplicate key errors fetching faves

* better layout, tested in more than just Firefox

To note:
--

* password reminders are disabled, only because I don't have a mail server set up
